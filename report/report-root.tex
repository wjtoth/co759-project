\begin{abstract}
Motivated by the problem of network quantization, we study hard-threshold activation networks. We propose multiple heuristics for generating targets in a target propagation framework for training such networks, and initiate an experimental study into their effectiveness. Furthermore, it has been speculated that hard-threshold deep neural networks are more resilient to adversarial example attacks than standard networks with continuous activation functions. We provide experimental evidence in favor of this hypothesis.
