\section{Generalization}
\paragraph{}
As stated above, the authors did not evaluate the generalization ability of the network, it seems to be assumed that such networks would perform better than Networks using activation functions that lead to an easier training procedure. We propose to evaluate the generalization ability of the hard-threshold networks, in comparison to the other networks.
