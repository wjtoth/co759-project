\section{Generalization}\label{generalization}
\paragraph{}

The authors did not evaluate the generalization ability of the network training using the training method introduced in the paper. When questioned about it, the authors responded that they needed to keep the paper short, but standard practices to avoid overfitting to the training dataset were applied, which were mentioned in the paper (\cite{FriesenReview}). We propose to evaluate the generalization ability of the hard-threshold networks, in comparison to the other networks, as well as the effects of using various training methods, including those that involve convex-combinatorial techniques, on the generalization gap.
