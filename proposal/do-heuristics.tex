\section{Discrete Optimization Heuristics}
\paragraph{}
We propose to study the mixed convex-combinatorial problem of training a hard-threshold network and test different heuristics than the proposed Beam Search (hill climbing on a set of solutions). 

Also, the authors state that a deep network might not always have a feasible set of targets for a given dataset. It would be interesting to study what causes a network not to have a feasible set of targets, and how can we deal with this. Maybe finding a maximum subset of data points having a feasible set of targets, or changing the network structure in a minimal way to allow feasible targets for the dataset.
