\section{Discrete Optimization Heuristics}\label{heuristics}
\paragraph{}
We propose to study the combinatorial aspect of mixed convex-combinatorial training problem and test different heuristics for setting loss-minimizng targets than the proposed Beam Search (hill climbing on a set of solutions). Such heuristics can include simulated annealing, and genetic ``algorithms". Time-permitting we want to explore more sophisticated discrete optimization algorithms for this problem such as attempting a (mixed) integer programming formulation and applying cutting planes.

An alternative line of inquiry could explore other ways of dealing with infeasible datasets, besides loss-minization. For example, training on a maximum subset of data points having a feasible set of targets, or minimally adapting the network to attain feasibility.
